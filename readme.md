This project illustrates the subway route between Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx, New York, and Citi Field, in Flushing, New York. The map points and lines show the most direct route between the stadiums using the MTA, New York City's metro network. The route covers three different metro lines, and takes about 40 minutes to an hour to complete depending on the time of day and line usage. The major functions I used were the .scrolling-text function to be able to contain my lengthy map description into a srollable text box instead of being an obtrusive fixed box. I used a source function to link the data I created in GeoJson.io and converted it to a .js file to the html file. When creating the map, I used a USGS basemap, as it had enough detail in its rendering of the roads and place names of New York City while maintaining a pleasing color palette on the map. Finally, I was able to use the onEachFeature function to change the color of the rendered data and add descriptions to my destination points on the map.
